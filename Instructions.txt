Open CMD in repo folder (where .git is)

commands:

Initialize your branch DO THIS FIRST BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES, THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE ONCE:

0 - Init.bat your_first_name

Pull Changes from main, DO THIS BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:

1 - PullChanges.bat your_first_name

Commit:

2 - Commit.bat "A message describing the changes in "" "

TLDR:

First Time setup: Open cmd in folder, type Init.bat your_first_name and enter

Working on project: open cmd in folder, type PullChanges.bat your_first_name before editing anything

After doing work: open cmd in folder, type Commit.bat "A message in quotes describing your changes"
